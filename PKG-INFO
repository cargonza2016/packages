Description: Ironic
        ======
        
        Ironic is an integrated OpenStack project which aims to provision bare
        metal machines instead of virtual machines, forked from the Nova Baremetal
        driver. It is best thought of as a bare metal hypervisor **API** and a set
        of plugins which interact with the bare metal hypervisors. By default, it
        will use PXE and IPMI together to provision and turn on/off machines,
        but Ironic also supports vendor-specific plugins which may implement
        additional functionality.
